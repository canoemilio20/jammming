## Scope

### Purpose
To develop a Spotify playlist creation tool that allows a created playlist to be saved to your Spotify account.

### Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- NextJS
- GitHub
- GitHub pages
- Spotify WebAPI

### Features
- Authentication: log into your Spotify account for authentication, in order to use the rest of this web app's features.
- Search music: search for music by typing a song name, a music genre, an artist name or an album name.
- Music display: see the results that match the search, which have related information displayed next to them.
    - By song name: besides its title, related information displayed will be its duration, music genre associated, artist associated and the albums in which it features.
    - By music genre: besides the genre name, related information displayed will be the total amount of results and each result with its related information.
    - By artist name: besides the artist name, related information displayed will be the total amount of results and each result with its related information.
    - By album name: besides the album name, related information displayed will be the total amount of results and each result with its related information.
- Playlist creation: create a new playlist, give it a name and a description. You can create multiple without having to save them your Spotify account before creating the next one, you can save or delete each one individually and you can save or delete all at the same time.

### Future work
Were this project to be continued later, additional features could include:
- Music player: a music player to let users listen the songs they are considerating to add to the playlist and also start listening to a created playlist before saving it to their account.
- Playlist image: an image to associate a given created playlist with.
